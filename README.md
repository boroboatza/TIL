# TIL
## TIL - Today I Learn is a repository dedicated to capturing and sharing small but valuable pieces of knowledge gained each day. It serves as a personal reference and a way to document daily learning progress. Whether it's a new coding technique, a useful shortcut in a software tool, or a fascinating fact about the world, TIL provides a space to record and organize these discoveries. By compiling and reviewing these tidbits regularly, users can reinforce their understanding and retain the knowledge for future use. TIL is a collaborative project where individuals can share their own insights and learn from others. With TIL, the learning never stops.
